    <h4>Who we are</h4>
    <p>Zelik is a movie renter app and also sharing of movies.
        What information does Zelik process?
        Zelik is a movie renter site, and we provide that service by operating a social network 
        site offering users the opportunity to connect to our global community of users and 
        sharing of movie. By joining Zelik, you enter a legal agreement with us and we process
        your data in order to provide your service under the terms of that agreement. 
    </p>
<p>
    You can only become a member of Zelik or use its features if you’re aged 18 or over or 
    the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than
    18.
    To join the Zelik platform you will have to complete our online registration form, 
    where we may ask you to provide us with information about you such as your name, your
    email address, your gender, your date of birth, your location details. You also have 
    the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. 
    Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any 
    time by accessing your “Profile” page, which gives you the chance to correct or 
    update (other than your email address and gender) your information at any time by 
    just logging in to Zelik. You can contact Zelik Customer Support Team through email address.
    Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your Profile such 
    as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide 
    this information to us when you create your Profile, including your sexual preferences
    and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs 
    or any video clips that you post on Zelik may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal 
    data. 
    Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive data about yourself, you are 
    explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.
    For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, 
    we require users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number. 
    We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Zelik 
    accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cyber crime – 
    they threaten the Zelik network and spoil things for everyone. We use a third 
    party provider for account verification who will keep your phone number for up to 90 
    days for fraud identification purposes. We collect and use your phone number on the 
    basis of our legitimate interests identified above and for the prevention of fraud.
    To prevent abuse of the app/site, Zelik uses automated decisions to block accounts 
    as part of its anti-spam procedures. In order to do this, our systems check accounts 
    and messages for content that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. 
    If an account or message meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and 
    Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached, the relevant account will 
    automatically be blocked. All users of accounts that have been blocked will be notified 
    that their account has been blocked and affected users can contact Zelik to contest the 
    decision.
    Please note that if your account is blocked, any account(s) that you have on our other 
    group platforms/applications may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud
    procedures.
    If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment
    information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax 
    purposes. Under data protection law, it is necessary for us to collect and process 
    this payment data to enable us to perform our contract with you and our ongoing 
    retention of this data is justified by our legitimate interests set out above.
    To enable Zelik to provide a free non-premium service, we process some limited 
    data (demographics and location) to drive targeted advertising in our legitimate 
    interest including sharing such data with advertising networks. We may also receive 
    data indirectly from such advertising networks. You can stop this within Settings
    but you will still see adverts, though they will be less relevant to you. Through 
    your device’s security settings you also have the option to prevent or limit device 
    identifiers being shared with third party advertisers and what use is made of the
    device identifiers. If you would like more information about this practice and to 
    know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please
    visit this page.</p>
   <p>
        Finally, we want to keep in touch with you to make sure you know about the 
       great promotions and offers we have available. If you’ve told us it’s OK,
       we will use your email address and phone number to send you information on these.
       You can withdraw this consent at any time via Settings in the app or website.
